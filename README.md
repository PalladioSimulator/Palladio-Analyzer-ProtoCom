# Palladio-Analyzer-ProtoCom
ProtoCom is a model-driven approach to generate performance prototypes and code stubs from PCM instances. Such performance prototypes mimic demands to different types of hardware resources to evaluate their performance in a realistic environment.

ProtoCom comes with a framework (e.g., for load generation and calibration) as well as extensible model-to-text transformations. Currently, only Java SE is fully supported. For Java EE (EJBs and Servlets), reference implementations and initial concepts exist.
